#' @description A function to parse bibliographic dataframes outputted from Rayyan, splitting up the 'notes' column into Inclusion/Exclusion decision, Labels, and Exclusion Reasons
#' @details big ole messy function (beta) to remove any old inclusion labels from abstract screening (found in the labels or parsed as html paragraphs)
#' @author Matt Lloyd Jones
#' @param rayyan_df A rayyan exported bibliography file

#' @return A dataframe
